			This is simultaneously a guide to designing a radical map using the new
			<a href="http://www.mapbox.com/studio" id="mapbox">Mapbox Studio</a> and an in-depth
			review of the latest cartographic tool from the open-source,
			<a href="http://www.osm.org" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> powerhouse.
		</p>

		<h3>What is <span id="mapbox">Mapbox Studio?</span></h3>
		<p>
			<em>
				<span id="mapbox">Mapbox Studio</span> is a web-based application which allows you to quickly style a map of the
				<strong>entire</strong> world.
			</em>
		</p>

		<h3>Let's unpack that</h3>
		<p>
			That statement is actually pretty f$#%ing amazing, and I don't want you to
			take it for granted. Simply put, this tool is unique in that it was
			<strong>literally impossible</strong> to achieve <em>not that long ago</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			When GIS first became <em>a thing</em>, it would have been nearly impossible to have
			enough computing power and storage space to make such a detailed map of the world.
			Let alone the fact that a worldwide, street-level dataset probably only existed
			in the halls of the world intelligence agencies.
		</p>
		<p>
			Think about how crazy it was in 1999 when Mapquest launched. It was a
			<em>revelation</em> that you could use the internet to find directions between
			(most) any two places on the planet. But this was still the sole domain of the
			super-powerful internet companies.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Steve Coast founded OpenStreetMap in 2005, we're starting to get the groundwork
			laid for everyone to be able to map the world, but not many people had the computing
			power, bandwith, and expertise to <em>consume</em> such a massive data source.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, in 2015, <span id="mapbox">Mapbox</span> has finally removed the last remaining
			technical hurdle. The <strong>entire workflow</strong> for making your own, customized
			map of the entire world is:
			<ol>
				<li>Create an account</li>
				<li>Log in</li>
				<li>Launch <span id="mapbox">Mapbox Studio</span> </li>
				<li>Map.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			With this perspective in mind, let's make a map.
		</p>
			<!-- TODO: Find a way to <hide> this segment -->
			<!-- To understand <strong>how</strong> amazing the above
			statement is, we'll have to go waaaay back.
			<em>Let's start at the beginning.</em>
		</p>

		<h4>
			In the beginning...
		</h4>
		<p>
			In humankind's cave-dwelling days, when maps weren't even <em>a thing</em>,
			 <strong>this was impossible.</strong>
		</p>

		<h4>When we formed tribes...</h4>
		<p>
			We needed maps to know where to hunt and where the next village was, but
			a <em>world</em> maps was <strong>impossible.</strong>
		</p>

		<h4>When we started farming...</h4>
		<p>
			We needed maps for our farms and our towns, but a world map was still
			<strong>impossible.</strong>
		</p>

		<h4>When the first cities formed...</h4>
		<p>
			We could make maps of our region, but going much further than that was
			still <strong>impossible.</strong>
		</p>

		<h4>When we conquered the seas...</h4>
		<p>
			Here's where we start getting closer. When explorers needed to get from Lisbon
			to Naples, they needed <em>charts</em> of a much larger area. Now we're getting
			<em>closer,</em> but think about what's needed to make a map of the
			Mediterranean. You need a fleet of ships, tons of crew, months of supplies,
			and lots of math. Basically, this was <strong>still impossible.</strong>
		</p>

		<h4>When Columbus sailed the ocean blue...</h4>
		<p>
			Getting closer still. As a civilization we're starting to get a
			<em>rough</em> idea of what's out there, but we still wouldn't get a
			<em>complete</em> picture for quite some time. Let's dub the possibility in
			1492 as <strong>extremely difficult</strong>, but not impossible any more.
		</p>

		<h4>When the sun never set on the British empire...</h4>
		<p>
			If you rule most of the world, you probably want to know <em>what exactly</em>
			you're ruling, so you put quite a bit of effort into mapping it. So, with
			the might of the entire British empire, you can now reasonably create a
			map of the entire world.
		</p>

		<h4>When planes were used for reconaissance...</h4>
		<p>
			Now we're getting an even better picture of our world, but you still need
			to be a government cartographer with specialized equipment to come close.
		</p>

		<h4>When we launched the first satellites...</h4>
		<p>
			Even closer, but the quantity and quality of the data, along with the
			specialized mapmaking tools, are reserved for the very few.
		</p>

		<h4>When OpenStreetMap was founded...</h4>
		<p>
			Now we get to the first place where <em>everyday</em> cartographers can
			get access to a dataset covering the <strong>entire world</strong> (eventually),
			but you have to have a very powerful machine and have a high technical
			proficciency to download, unpack, process, and store <code>planet.osm</code>.
		</p>

		<h4>When <span id="mapbox">Mapbox</span> creates OSM vector tiles...</h4>
		<p>
			Finally, we've arrived at <strong>possible.</strong>
		</p> -->

		<!-- <ul>
			<li>Web-based application</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The first few cartography tools that <span id="mapbox">Mapbox</span> created
			were cross-platform, open-source <em>desktop</em> applications.
		</p>

		and their amazing
		<a href="http://www.osm.org" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a>
		data and

		using <span id="mapbox">Mapbox's</span>
		<code>JSON</code>-based graphics styling language -->

		<h2>Making a map</h2>
		<p>
			<small>
			<em>(Note: These screenshots were taken during the beta and may vary slightly from the current version.)</em>
			</small> <br>
			It's pretty simple to get started. Just create a new style, and then pick
			from one of <span id="mapbox">Mapbox</span>'s existing styles or start from
			a blank source.
		</p>
		<img src="img/new_style.PNG" alt="" class="shadow"/>

		<h3>The blank source</h3>
		<p>
			It can be rather daunting to start from the ground up, but if you're wanting
			to really make something unique I think it's a must.
		</p>
		<img src="img/blank.png" alt="" class="shadow"/>
		<p>
			This doesn't look to dissimilar to a traditional GIS program. You launch it,
			and it sits there - empty - waiting for your data.
		</p>

		<h3>Selecting data</h3>
		<p>
			Thankfully <small><em>(and miraculously, as mentioned previously)</em></small>,
			<span id="mapbox">Mapbox</span> has provided the data for the
			<strong>entire world</strong> for you to style (courtesy of OpenStreetMap).
		</p>
		<p>
			Start by opening the "New Layer" pane. This changes the map view from "Cartography"
			to "X-Ray" mode, allowing you to see all the data behind the scenes.
		</p>
		<img src="img/add_data.png" alt="" class="shadow"/>
		<p>
			You get a preview of the depth and breadth of information available at your fingertips.
			You just need to click on the data in the map that you want to style and hit "Select.""
		</p>
		<img src="img/select.png" alt="" class="shadow"/>
		<p>
			Once a layer has been selected, the data is highlighted in the map. This will
			be especially helpful later when filters are required.
		</p>
		<img src="img/selected.png" alt="" class="shadow"/>
		<p>
			Go ahead and press "Create Layer" and the map switches back to Style mode.
		</p>

		<h3>Styling data</h3>
		<p>
			Now we get our first look at the map styling tools. Also, we can breathe
			a slight sigh of relief that our map is no longer blank.
		</p>
		<img src="img/style1.png" alt="" class="shadow"/>
		<p>
			Let's see what we have to work with.
		</p>
		<img src="img/polygon_tools.png" alt="" class="shadow"/>
		<p>
			Let's break down our toolbox.
			<ul>
				<li>Color picker</li>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="img/colorpicker.png" alt="" class="shadow"/></li>
				</ul>
				<li>Pattern Picker</li>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="img/patternpicker.png" alt="" class="shadow"/></li>
				</ul>
				<li>Opacity Slider</li>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="img/opacityslider.png" alt="" class="shadow"/></li>
				</ul>
				<li>Antialias Toggle <small>(a 1px outline)</small> </li>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="img/antialias.png" alt="" class="shadow"/></li>
					<li><em>Notice the handy popup? Every descriptive text does that just in case you're wondering what a property does.</em></li>
				</ul>
				<li>Antialias Color Picker</li>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="img/antialias_color.png" alt="" class="shadow"/></li>
				</ul>
				<li>Translation Settings</li>
				<ul>
					<li><img src="img/translate.png" alt="" class="shadow"/></li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			That's a pretty standard set of tools, not a lot of mind-blowing stuff in the
			polygon styling toolbelt...
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh, except did I mention...? Everything you do <strong>changes live??</strong>
